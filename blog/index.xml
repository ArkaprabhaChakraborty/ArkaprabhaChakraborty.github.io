All of these are some &amp;ldquo;first thought&amp;rdquo; blogs, which I decided I should be sharing with you all :). Why this blog post? Well I could have spent some time and configured a breadcrumb page, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t wanna do that. It would have slowed me down :). That being said, the code to my portfolio is open source [Wow what a surprise :P] and if you are looking to make your first PR you can just start by creating a breadcrumb page fo this blog :)</description></item><item><title>Setup a lovely little portfolio with hugo</title><link>https://arkaprabhachakraborty.github.io/blog/portfolio_with_hugo/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://arkaprabhachakraborty.github.io/blog/portfolio_with_hugo/</guid><description>Hugo is an amazing tool. It&amp;rsquo;s a powerful static site generator that can be used to create a beautiful websites. Hugo, is world&amp;rsquo;s fastest static website engine. What I like about Hugo is it&amp;rsquo;s speed and flexibility.
For my blog I can just use some simple Markdown files, and Hugo build the site for me. This helps me to create a blog that is easy to manage. For starters I followed the Hugo quick start tutorial to setup a my portfolio website.</description></item></channel></rss>
