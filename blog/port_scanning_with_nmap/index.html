<p>To scan for all open TCP open ports on a target, we use:</p>

For this case we are going for level 1 verbosity. But higher levels can be achieved using <code>-vv</code> or <code>-vvv</code>.</p>

<p>Since we ran nmap without root privileges, nmap defaulted to a TCP connect scan. The equivalent of which can be achieved using</p>
<div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash>nmap -sT -v scanme.nmap.org
</code></pre></div><p>In a TCP connect scan, nmap opens up ports like a browser or a client would, making this scan a bit slower and &lsquo;noisy&rsquo; than a TCP SYN scan. This is because the TCP connect scan requires the full TCP handshake to be completed, and the target system can log this activity.</p>
<h2 id=stealth-scanning>Stealth scanning</h2>
<p>This is the default scan type used by Nmap under root privileges. By default, Nmap performs a SYN Scan, though it substitutes a connect scan if the user does not have proper privileges to send raw packets (requires root access on Unix). Unprivileged users can only execute connect and FTP bounce scans.</p>
<p>For stealth scanning, we use the <code>-sS</code> flag to launch a TCP SYN scan. This scan type requires root privileges.</p>

</code></pre></div><p>This is a much faster scan than the TCP connect scan. This is because the TCP SYN scan does not require the full TCP handshake to be completed, making it a stealthier scan as the target system will not log the activity of this scan.</p>
<h2 id=ack-scanning>ACK scanning</h2>
<p>The ACK scan is fundamentally different from the TCP SYN and Connect scans. It does not show an open or filtered ports. By default, the ACK scan probe packet has only the ACK flag set. When scanning systems, ports that respond to nmap&rsquo;s ACK probes are labelled as &ldquo;unfiltered&rdquo;, as both open and closed probes return responses with RST flags.</p>
<p>For a TCP ACK scan we can use the <code>-sA</code> flag. This scan type requires root privileges.</p>

</code></pre></div><p>For the above scan we see all ports are filtered. This happens as nmap ACK scan cannot determine whether the port is open because packet filtering prevents its probes from reaching the port. The filtering could be from a dedicated firewall device, router rules, or host-based firewall software.</p>
<p>Only the ACK scan labels ports as unfiltered. This information can be used to map firewall rule sets, classify ports into this state. Scanning unfiltered ports with other scan types such as Window scan, SYN scan, or FIN scan, may help resolve whether the port is open.</p>
<h2 id=window-scanning>Window scanning</h2>
<p>This works exactly like the TCP ACK scan, except it makes use of the implementations on certain systems to differentiate between open and filtered ports, rather than always printing unfiltered when an RST is returned. It does this by examining the TCP Window value of the RST packets returned.</p>
<p>According to the nmap <a href=https://nmap.org/book/scan-methods-window-scan.html>documentation</a>, the windows scan sends the same bare ACK probe as ACK scan but interprets the results as follows:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Probe Response</th>
<th style=text-align:center>Assigned State</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>TCP RST response with non-zero window field</td>
<td style=text-align:center>open</td>

<td style=text-align:center>filtered</td>

</table>
<p>For a TCP Window scan we can use the <code>-sW</code> flag. This scan type requires root privileges.</p>

<h1 id=special-flag-based-tcp-port-scans><a href>Special FLAG based TCP port scans</a></h1>
<p>This can be used to differentiate between open and closed ports. The following three types of scans exactly the same in behavior except for the TCP flags set in probe packets. These FLAG based scans normally do not receive any response back from the target, other than an RST packet [Page 65 of <a href=http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc793.txt>RFC 793</a> says this in detail]. Responses are treated as shown in the Table below.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Probe Response</th>
<th style=text-align:center>Assigned State</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>No response received (even after retransmissions)</td>
<td style=text-align:center>open|filtered</td>

<td style=text-align:center>closed</td>

<p>In nmap filtered means the packets were dropped. But for <code>open|filtered</code>, nmap is unable to determine whether a port is open or filtered. This occurs for scan types in which open ports give no response.
The UDP, IP protocol, FLAG based scans are the only ones which classify ports this way.</p>
<h2 id=null-scanning>NULL scanning</h2>
<p>The TCP NULL scan is a special flag based scan that does not set any bits (TCP flag header is 0). We use the <code>-sN</code> flag for this scan. This scan type requires root privileges.</p>

<p>The Maimon scan is named after its discoverer, Uriel Maimon. He described the technique in Phrack Magazine issue #49 (November 1996). This is a similar scan type like the NULL, FIN and Xmas scans, except that the probe is FIN/ACK.</p>
<p>We can use the <code>-sM</code> flag to perform a Maimon scan. This scan type requires root privileges.</p>

<p>The UDP scanning is a type of port scanning that uses the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) to determine which ports are open on a target host. UDP scan is activated with the <code>-sU</code> option. It can be combined with a TCP scan type such as SYN scan (using <code>-sS</code>) to check both protocols during the same run.</p>

<p>The IP protocol scanning can allow us to determine which IP protocols (TCP, ICMP, IGMP, etc.) are supported by target machines. This is not a proper port scanning technique as it cycles through IP protocol numbers rather than TCP or UDP port numbers.</p>
<p>To do this we can use the <code>-sO</code> flag. This scan type requires root privileges.</p>

</code></pre></div><h1 id=idle-scanning><a href>Idle Scanning</a></h1>
<p>The idle scanning option can mask the attacker&rsquo;s IP address by using a zombie host to send the packets. This is done by using the <code>-sI</code> flag. This scan type requires root privileges. For an example we can use the following command:</p>
<div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash>sudo nmap -sI -v www.example.org scanme.nmap.org
</code></pre></div><p>The first step however is to find an appropriate zombie host. The host has to be idle. Our zombie host in the above example is <code>www.example.org</code>. The output of the above command is as follows:</p>

<p>There are two primary types of SCTP scanning methods provided by nmap. The first is the <code>INIT</code> scan which is used to determine which SCTP ports are open. The second is the <code>COOKIE-ECHO</code> scan which is used to determine which SCTP ports are open and which are closed. The <code>INIT</code> scan is activated with the <code>-sY</code> flag and the <code>COOKIE-ECHO</code> scan is activated with the <code>-sZ</code> flag. Both of these scan types require root privileges.</p>
