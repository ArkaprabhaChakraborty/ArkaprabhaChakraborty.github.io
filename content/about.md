```Cpp
Welcome to my little corner on the Internet.

My name is **Arkaprabha Chakraborty** but you can also call me **Tintin**. 
I'm from Kolkata, West Bengal, India. I'm a student developer, open source 
enthusiast and a wannabe security researcher.

:: Things I <3:
      - Tinkering with OS, Networking and Web applications.
      - Exploit Development & Evasion Research.
      - Participating in CTFs.
      - Writing Blogs.
      - Contributing to various FOSS projects regularly.
```

## 🧠 Philosophy
I believe security research should be grounded in real systems - not just theoretical models. I’m especially drawn to projects where empirical methods (like reverse engineering, dynamic analysis, or causal reasoning) are used to understand and secure complex software systems.

I enjoy finding unconventional solutions to hard problems, and I spend most of my time learning, breaking, building, and documenting that process. Whether it’s digging into a registry key, intercepting a syscall chain, or exploring undocumented APIs, I’m probably knee-deep in something weird and wonderful.

I actively contribute to open-source, especially in areas intersecting infosec and developer tooling. Whether it's writing Frida hooks, parsing weird logs, or improving reverse engineering workflows - I try to give back whenever I can.

If you like weird bugs, undocumented behaviors, or just good ol' shell-based exploration, you’re in the right place.
