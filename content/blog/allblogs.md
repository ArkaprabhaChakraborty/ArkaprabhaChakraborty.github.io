These are all of my blogs till now in an organised manner. All of these are some "first thought" blogs, which I decided I should be sharing with you all :). Why this blog post? Well I could have spent some time and configured a breadcrumb page, but I didn't wanna do that. It would have slowed me down :). That being said, the code to my portfolio is open source [Wow what a surprise :P] and if you are looking to make your first PR you can just start by creating a breadcrumb page for this blog :)
