# [Attack Sources](#attack_sources)

- **An attack can be perpetrated by an insider or from outside the organization**. 
    - An **inside attack** is an attack initiated by an entity inside the security perimeter (an insider), i.e., an entity that is authorized to access system resources but uses them in a way not approved by those who granted the authorization.
    - An **outside attack** is initiated from outside the perimeter, by an unauthorized or illegitimate user of the system (an outsider). On the Internet, potential outside attackers range from amateur pranksters to organized criminals, international terrorists, and hostile governments.
- A resource (both physical or logical), called **an asset, can have one or more vulnerabilities that can be exploited by a threat agent in a threat action**. The result can potentially **compromise the Confidentiality, Integrity or Availability [Also referred to as CIA triad] properties of resources** (potentially different from the vulnerable one) of the organization and other involved parties (customers, suppliers).
- An attacker need not remove data for there to be a problem. Reading of material, such as a secret formula, or encryption and extortion for the key could be done without removal of any data.
