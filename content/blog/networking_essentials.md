This is kinda a sub-blog within my main blog. This is a collection of notes I've taken while studying for the CCNA. I'm not sure if I'll ever take the exam, but I did learn a lot and some cool badges which will probably go away in a few years :).

Networking knowledge is one of the most basic skills you must have before embarking on "H4c!<in6", or start your DevOps or Development journey. These blogs might help you with the correct amount of resources to learn from.
