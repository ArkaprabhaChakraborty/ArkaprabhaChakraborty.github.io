Organization&amp;rsquo;s culture is like a shadow of the organization. The processes, behaviour and tools used by the organization shape it&amp;rsquo;s culture, just like a person&amp;rsquo;s clothing, dressing sense and body language shapes them.

To change culture, we need to change the organization&amp;rsquo;s processes, behaviour and tools. This is a long term process and requires a lot of effort and time.</description></item><item><title>DevOps Basics - Part 1</title><link>https://arkaprabhachakraborty.github.io/blog/devops_basics_1/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://arkaprabhachakraborty.github.io/blog/devops_basics_1/</guid><description>What is DevOps?
