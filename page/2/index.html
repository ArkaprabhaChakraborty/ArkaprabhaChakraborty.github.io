<time>Dec 22, 2022</time>
<br><div class=description>
What is an organization&rsquo;s culture? Organization&rsquo;s culture is like a shadow of the organization. The processes, behaviour and tools used by the organization shape it&rsquo;s culture, just like a person&rsquo;s clothing, dressing sense and body language shapes them. This &ldquo;shadow&rdquo; cannot be changed directly and abruptly, without changing the &ldquo;object&rdquo; casting the &ldquo;shadow&rdquo;.
To change culture, we need to change the organization&rsquo;s processes, behaviour and tools. This is a long term process and requires a lot of effort and time.&mldr;

What is DevOps? DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increases an organization’s ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity.
The main purpose of DevOps is to boost developer productivity.
Under DevOps model, the operations team is no longer isolated. Sometimes, the two teams, ie, the development team and operations team are merged into a single team where the engineers work across the entire application lifecycle, from development and test to deployment to operations, and develop a range of skills not limited to a single function.&mldr;

The term &ldquo;white hat&rdquo; in Internet slang refers to an ethical hacker. This classification also includes individuals who perform penetration tests and vulnerability assessments within a contractual agreement. Black Hat A black hat hacker is a hacker who violates computer security to be malicious or for personal gain.&mldr;

What is ZAP? Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP) is the world&rsquo;s most popular open source web application scanner. ZAP is free to use and tons of different add-ons are available to extend its functionality. Even though ZAP is officially called a &ldquo;web application scanner&rdquo;, we, the contributors and the core team of ZAP, sometimes unofficialy call it an &ldquo;Integrated Hacking Environment (IHE)&rdquo;.&mldr;

These are all of my blogs till now in an organised manner. All of these are some &ldquo;first thought&rdquo; blogs, which I decided I should be sharing with you all :). Why this blog post? Well I could have spent some time and configured a breadcrumb page, but I didn&rsquo;t wanna do that. It would have slowed me down :). That being said, the code to my portfolio is open source [Wow what a surprise :P] and if you are looking to make your first PR you can just start by creating a breadcrumb page for this blog :)&mldr;
