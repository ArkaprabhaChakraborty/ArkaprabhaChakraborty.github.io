The wise way to invest your time and money wisely is to perform an application portfolio analysis (APA), to identify which applications should be focused on.
There are 4 dimesions of an APA. For each category you collect the data and you translate it into a relative graph.&mldr;

Find your MVC Minimum viable cluster (MVC) is a subset of applications that are the most important to the business and are the best candidates for a DevOps transformation. Improving the MVC leads to faster and more reliable delivery of business value.
Thge concept behind this is that of a weakest link in a chain. the weakest link in a chain defines the overall doability of a chain. Similarly the applicatiion witth lowest maturity in a cluster tends to define oyour ability to deliver.&mldr;

Technology People and Process Ecosystem Technology In this dimension, you need to cover things like:

What is an organization&rsquo;s culture? Organization&rsquo;s culture is like a shadow of the organization. The processes, behaviour and tools used by the organization shape it&rsquo;s culture, just like a person&rsquo;s clothing, dressing sense and body language shapes them. This &ldquo;shadow&rdquo; cannot be changed directly and abruptly, without changing the &ldquo;object&rdquo; casting the &ldquo;shadow&rdquo;.
To change culture, we need to change the organization&rsquo;s processes, behaviour and tools. This is a long term process and requires a lot of effort and time.&mldr;

What is DevOps? DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increases an organization’s ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity.
The main purpose of DevOps is to boost developer productivity.
Under DevOps model, the operations team is no longer isolated. Sometimes, the two teams, ie, the development team and operations team are merged into a single team where the engineers work across the entire application lifecycle, from development and test to deployment to operations, and develop a range of skills not limited to a single function.&mldr;

Classes of Attackers White Hat A white hat hacker breaks security for non-malicious reasons, perhaps to test their own security system or while working for a security company which makes security software. The term &ldquo;white hat&rdquo; in Internet slang refers to an ethical hacker. This classification also includes individuals who perform penetration tests and vulnerability assessments within a contractual agreement. Black Hat A black hat hacker is a hacker who violates computer security to be malicious or for personal gain.&mldr;
